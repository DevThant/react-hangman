The TypeScript error you're seeing is because the event parameter doesn't have an explicit type declared. TypeScript requires explicit types for a more rigorous type checking process, ensuring you are using the expected properties and methods associated with that type.

To resolve this issue, you should specify the type of the `event` parameter using the `MouseEvent` type for click events. This will inform TypeScript that `event` is a mouse event, giving you access to the appropriate properties and methods. Here's the corrected version:

```javascript
<script setup lang="ts" generic="T extends MinimalSearchValue">
import { ref, onMounted, onBeforeUnmount } from 'vue';
import AppInput from '@/components/common/formElements/input/Input.vue';
import AppIconButton from '@/components/common/icon/IconButton.vue';
import { useI18n } from 'vue-i18n';
import {
  matchedResultsFilter,
  MinimalSearchValue,
  parseSearchValue
} from '@/components/common/search/helpers/match.js';

defineOptions({ name: 'SearchProperties' });

// Your existing props, emit, and other constants setup here ...

const opened = ref(false);
const searchDropdown = ref<HTMLElement | null>(null);

const focusDropdown = () => {
  opened.value = true;
};

const closeDropdown = () => {
  opened.value = false;
};

const checkClickOutside = (event: MouseEvent) => {
  if (searchDropdown.value && !searchDropdown.value.contains(event.target as Node) && opened.value) {
    closeDropdown();
  }
};

onMounted(() => {
  document.addEventListener('click', checkClickOutside);
  window.addEventListener('keydown', (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (event.key === "Escape") {
      closeDropdown();
    }
  });
});

onBeforeUnmount(() => {
  document.removeEventListener('click', checkClickOutside);
  window.removeEventListener('keydown', closeDropdown);
});

// Remaining part of your script...
</script>
```

### Changes made:

1. **Event Typing**: Added type `MouseEvent` to the `checkClickOutside` function parameter and `KeyboardEvent` to the keydown event listener.
2. **Consistent Type Checking**: By using explicit typing, TypeScript can now ensure the use of properties and methods is valid for the specified event types.

This should address the TypeScript error and enable proper event handling in your Vue component setup.


-----
You're right about the issues with the `focusEvent` function. It's not being used, and the typo with `.closet` instead of `.closest` would indeed cause an error.

Let's correct these issues by integrating the correct event handling directly into the component lifecycle without the unused `focusEvent` function. Here's a revised approach focusing directly on handling clicks and keydown events properly:

```javascript
<script setup lang="ts" generic="T extends MinimalSearchValue">
import { ref, onMounted, onBeforeUnmount } from 'vue';
import AppInput from '@/components/common/formElements/input/Input.vue';
import AppIconButton from '@/components/common/icon/IconButton.vue';
import { useI18n } from 'vue-i18n';
import {
  matchedResultsFilter,
  MinimalSearchValue,
  parseSearchValue
} from '@/components/common/search/helpers/match.js';

defineOptions({ name: 'SearchProperties' });

// Your existing props, emit, and other constants setup here ...

const opened = ref(false);
const searchDropdown = ref<HTMLElement | null>(null);

const focusDropdown = () => {
  opened.value = true;
};

const closeDropdown = () => {
  opened.value = false;
};

const checkClickOutside = (event) => {
  if (searchDropdown.value && !searchDropdown.value.contains(event.target as Node) && opened.value) {
    closeDropdown();
  }
};

onMounted(() => {
  document.addEventListener('click', checkClickOutside);
  window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === "Escape") {
      closeDropdown();
    }
  });
});

onBeforeUnmount(() => {
  document.removeEventListener('click', checkClickOutside);
  window.removeEventListener('keydown', closeDropdown);
});

// Remaining part of your script...
</script>
```

### Adjustments:

1. **Removed Unused Function**: The `focusEvent` function was removed.
2. **Click Handling**: The `checkClickOutside` function now checks if a click is outside the search dropdown and closes it if so.
3. **Keydown Event**: Listens for the Escape key to close the dropdown.

This setup keeps the dropdown open when interacting with items inside it and only closes it when clicking outside or pressing the Escape key, aligning with your initial requirements.

------
To keep the dropdown of your search bar open during interactions inside it and only close when the user clicks outside or presses ESC, you need to adjust the `@blur` event handling. Specifically, you should modify the `closeDropdown` method to better handle the focus state. Here's a revised version of your script with the necessary changes:

### Adjustments in `<template>`:

1. Remove `@blur="closeDropdown"` from the `<app-input>` component.
2. Adjust the `@blur` handler in the `div` containing the class "results" to check if the focus has moved outside the dropdown.

### Updated `<script setup>` section:

```javascript
<script setup lang="ts" generic="T extends MinimalSearchValue">
import { computed, ref, onMounted, onBeforeUnmount } from 'vue';
import AppInput from '@/components/common/formElements/input/Input.vue';
import AppIconButton from '@/components/common/icon/IconButton.vue';
import { useI18n } from 'vue-i18n';
import {
  matchedResultsFilter,
  MinimalSearchValue,
  parseSearchValue
} from '@/components/common/search/helpers/match.js';

defineOptions({ name: 'SearchProperties' });

// Your existing props, emit, and other constants setup here ...

const opened = ref(false);
const searchDropdown = ref<HTMLElement | null>(null);
const focusEvent = (e: FocusEvent) => {
  if (!searchDropdown.value || !(e.relatedTarget as Node).closest('.search-property-wrapper')) {
    closeDropdown();
  }
};

const focusDropdown = () => {
  opened.value = true;
};

const closeDropdown = () => {
  opened.value = false;
};

onMounted(() => {
  document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    if (!searchDropdown.value?.contains(event.target as Node) && opened.value) {
      closeDropdown();
    }
  });
  window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === "Escape") {
      closeDropdown();
    }
  });
});

onBeforeUnmount(() => {
  document.removeEventListener('click', closeDropdown);
  window.removeEventListener('keydown', closeDropdown);
});

// Remaining part of your script...
</script>
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Focus Handling**: Removed the `@blur` event from `app-input` and modified the blur handling in the dropdown `div` to check if the new focus is outside the search component. This prevents the dropdown from closing when interacting with items inside it.
2. **Click Outside Handling**: Added a global click listener to close the dropdown when clicking outside the component.
3. **Escape Key Handling**: Added a listener for the Escape key to close the dropdown.

This setup ensures the dropdown remains open when interacting with elements inside it but will close when the user clicks outside the dropdown area or presses the Escape key.

The error message you're seeing in the backend suggests there's an issue with the handling of the product state, specifically related to determining if a product is frozen. The `NullPointerException` indicates that the method attempting to fetch the frozen state is receiving a `null` value, which it doesn't handle properly.

Here's a breakdown of the issue and steps to resolve it:

### Problem
- The method `ensureProductIsNotFrozen` in `ProductManagementService` is trying to invoke `booleanValue()` on a `Boolean` that is null. This happens because the method `isFrozen()` from `ExtendedProduct` returns null, which isn't expected by your code.

### Solutions
1. **Check for Null in Backend Service**: Modify the `ensureProductIsNotFrozen` method to handle possible null values. This will prevent your application from crashing when the product's frozen status isn't properly initialized or fetched. For example:
   ```java
   public void ensureProductIsNotFrozen(String productId) throws ProductFrozenException {
       ExtendedProduct product = productService.getProductById(productId);
       if (product != null && Boolean.TRUE.equals(product.isFrozen())) {
           throw new ProductFrozenException("Product is frozen and cannot be edited.");
       }
   }
   ```
   This code checks if `product` is not null and then explicitly checks if `isFrozen()` is true. This avoids the `NullPointerException` if `isFrozen()` is null.

2. **Review Product Fetching Logic**: Ensure that wherever you're fetching the product details, the product is fully initialized, including its frozen status. There might be a flaw in the logic where the product's attributes are set, or it might not be fetching the correct details from the database.

3. **Frontend Handling**: On the frontend, ensure you are handling these errors gracefully. When such an error occurs, provide feedback to the user that something went wrong, which you're already doing by logging "Failed to update track item." However, you might want to expand this to more user-friendly feedback using a UI element like a toast notification or error message display.

### Additional Note
Regarding the `submitEditRequests` method and the `props.productId` issue, it seems like `productId` isn't directly available in your component's props or context. Make sure you're either:

- Passing `productId` as a prop to each component that requires it.
- Fetching it from a global state or context that's accessible within the component, as seen in your other components using `productsStore.activeProductId`.

By fixing the null handling in the backend and ensuring the frontend properly uses `productId`, you should be able to resolve both the server-side error and the client-side integration issues.
