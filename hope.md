The error message you're seeing in the backend suggests there's an issue with the handling of the product state, specifically related to determining if a product is frozen. The `NullPointerException` indicates that the method attempting to fetch the frozen state is receiving a `null` value, which it doesn't handle properly.

Here's a breakdown of the issue and steps to resolve it:

### Problem
- The method `ensureProductIsNotFrozen` in `ProductManagementService` is trying to invoke `booleanValue()` on a `Boolean` that is null. This happens because the method `isFrozen()` from `ExtendedProduct` returns null, which isn't expected by your code.

### Solutions
1. **Check for Null in Backend Service**: Modify the `ensureProductIsNotFrozen` method to handle possible null values. This will prevent your application from crashing when the product's frozen status isn't properly initialized or fetched. For example:
   ```java
   public void ensureProductIsNotFrozen(String productId) throws ProductFrozenException {
       ExtendedProduct product = productService.getProductById(productId);
       if (product != null && Boolean.TRUE.equals(product.isFrozen())) {
           throw new ProductFrozenException("Product is frozen and cannot be edited.");
       }
   }
   ```
   This code checks if `product` is not null and then explicitly checks if `isFrozen()` is true. This avoids the `NullPointerException` if `isFrozen()` is null.

2. **Review Product Fetching Logic**: Ensure that wherever you're fetching the product details, the product is fully initialized, including its frozen status. There might be a flaw in the logic where the product's attributes are set, or it might not be fetching the correct details from the database.

3. **Frontend Handling**: On the frontend, ensure you are handling these errors gracefully. When such an error occurs, provide feedback to the user that something went wrong, which you're already doing by logging "Failed to update track item." However, you might want to expand this to more user-friendly feedback using a UI element like a toast notification or error message display.

### Additional Note
Regarding the `submitEditRequests` method and the `props.productId` issue, it seems like `productId` isn't directly available in your component's props or context. Make sure you're either:

- Passing `productId` as a prop to each component that requires it.
- Fetching it from a global state or context that's accessible within the component, as seen in your other components using `productsStore.activeProductId`.

By fixing the null handling in the backend and ensuring the frontend properly uses `productId`, you should be able to resolve both the server-side error and the client-side integration issues.
