Sure, here’s a detailed overview of the Halo universe lore up to the start of Master Chief’s story:

Ancient History

The Precursors and the Forerunners

	•	Precursors: The Precursors were an ancient and advanced race believed to have created the Milky Way galaxy and its various species, including humans and Forerunners. They held the Mantle of Responsibility, a philosophy of stewardship over all life.
	•	Forerunners: The Forerunners were another ancient and highly advanced species. They revered the Precursors and inherited the Mantle of Responsibility, aiming to protect and cultivate life in the galaxy.

The Flood

	•	The Flood: A parasitic species capable of infecting and controlling other life forms. The Precursors, after being nearly exterminated by the Forerunners, transformed into the Flood as an act of vengeance.

The Forerunner-Flood War

	•	War: The Flood emerged as a major threat to the galaxy, leading to a prolonged and devastating war with the Forerunners. The Flood’s ability to infect and control sentient beings made them a nearly unstoppable force.

Halo Array

	•	Creation: In a desperate bid to stop the Flood, the Forerunners created the Halo Array, a series of massive ring-shaped superweapons. These rings were designed to wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy, starving the Flood of hosts.
	•	Activation: The Forerunners eventually activated the Halo Array, sacrificing themselves and all sentient life in the galaxy to stop the Flood. This event is known as the Great Purification.

Human Prehistory and Rise

Ancient Humanity
