To squash multiple commits into a single commit during an interactive rebase, you can change the command for the subsequent commits from `pick` to `squash` (or `s` for short). Here's how to do it:

1. After running `git rebase -i HEAD~4`, you will see a list of your commits in Vim.

2. Change the `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for all commits except the first one. The first commit message will be used as the base commit message, and you can edit it after squashing. For example, your Vim editor should look something like this:

   ```
   pick 4a.... Apply suggestions from code review
   squash 66.... Apply suggestions from code review
   squash 6c.... Apply suggestions from code review
   squash 311416| Update toaster to show progress.
   ```

3. Save and close the Vim editor (`:wq`).

4. Git will combine these commits and open a new editor window where you can modify the commit message for the new squashed commit. You can edit the commit message as needed, combining information from all the squashed commits or creating a new, comprehensive commit message.

   Example of the editor with combined commit messages:
   ```
   # This is a combination of 4 commits.
   # The first commit's message is:
   Apply suggestions from code review

   # This is the 2nd commit message:
   Apply suggestions from code review

   # This is the 3rd commit message:
   Apply suggestions from code review

   # This is the 4th commit message:
   Update toaster to show progress.
   ```

   Modify this to create a single, comprehensive commit message:
   ```
   Update toaster to show progress

   - Applied suggestions from code review
   - Improved toaster functionality
   ```

5. Save and close the Vim editor (`:wq`).

6. Push the updated feature branch to the remote repository with force to update the commit history:
   ```sh
   git push --force-with-lease origin feature/117-new-feature
   ```

### Summary of Steps

1. Run interactive rebase:
   ```sh
   git rebase -i HEAD~4
   ```

2. Change the `pick` to `squash` for all commits except the first one in the Vim editor:
   ```
   pick 4a.... Apply suggestions from code review
   squash 66.... Apply suggestions from code review
   squash 6c.... Apply suggestions from code review
   squash 311416| Update toaster to show progress.
   ```

3. Save and close the Vim editor (`:wq`).

4. Edit the commit message in the new editor window to combine the information or create a new message.

5. Save and close the Vim editor (`:wq`).

6. Push the changes forcefully to update the remote branch:
   ```sh
   git push --force-with-lease origin feature/117-new-feature
   ```

This will squash the four commits into a single commit with a new, comprehensive commit message.

### Addressing Insufficient Commit Messages

You can rebase your commits to clean up the commit messages. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Switch to your feature branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout feature/117-new-feature
   ```

2. **Rebase interactively to rewrite the commit history**:
   ```sh
   git rebase -i HEAD~5
   ```
   Replace `5` with the number of commits you want to modify. This will open an editor with a list of your recent commits.

3. **Change `pick` to `reword` for the commits you want to edit**. Save and close the editor to proceed. You will then be prompted to enter new commit messages for the selected commits.

4. **Push the rewritten commit history to your remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

### Rebase Your Branch with the Main Branch

To rebase your feature branch onto the latest main branch and handle conflicts:

1. **Switch to main branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```

3. **Pull the latest changes into local main branch**:
   ```sh
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Switch back to feature branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout feature/117-new-feature
   ```

5. **Rebase your feature branch onto the main branch**:
   ```sh
   git rebase main
   ```

6. **Resolve any conflicts that arise**. Git will notify you of conflicts. Open the affected files, resolve the conflicts, and then:
   ```sh
   git add <resolved_file>
   ```

7. **Continue the rebase after resolving conflicts**:
   ```sh
   git rebase --continue
   ```

8. **Force push the updated feature branch to the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git push --force-with-lease origin feature/117-new-feature
   ```

### Final Steps to Complete the Pull Request

1. **Create a pull request** from the `feature/117-new-feature` branch to the `main` branch on your repository platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

2. **Complete the pull request** after ensuring there are no more conflicts and the feature branch is properly rebased onto the main branch.

### Summary of Commands

Here’s a summary of the commands you'll use:

```sh
# Rebase to clean up commit messages
git checkout feature/117-new-feature
git rebase -i HEAD~5
# Change 'pick' to 'reword' and save, then rewrite commit messages
git push --force-with-lease

# Rebase your branch with the latest main branch
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/117-new-feature
git rebase main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git add <resolved_file>
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/117-new-feature
```

This process will help you clean up your commit history and rebase your feature branch onto the latest main branch, ensuring a smooth and conflict-free pull request.

You are correct that it's generally a good practice to ensure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch before creating a pull request. This helps avoid conflicts and ensures your changes are compatible with the latest codebase. Here’s a step-by-step process to update your branch and create a pull request:

1. **Switch to your main branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```

3. **Pull the latest changes into your local main branch**:
   ```sh
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Switch back to your feature branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout feature/117-new-feature
   ```

5. **Merge the latest changes from main into your feature branch**:
   ```sh
   git merge main
   ```

6. **Resolve any merge conflicts that arise**. If there are conflicts, Git will notify you, and you’ll need to manually resolve them in the affected files. After resolving conflicts, add the resolved files:
   ```sh
   git add <resolved_file>
   ```

7. **Complete the merge by committing the changes**:
   ```sh
   git commit
   ```

8. **Push the updated feature branch to the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/117-new-feature
   ```

9. **Create a pull request** from your `feature/117-new-feature` branch to the `main` branch on your repository platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

This process ensures that your branch incorporates the latest updates from the main branch, reducing the likelihood of conflicts and making it easier for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.
